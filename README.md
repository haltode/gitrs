# gitrs

A small re-implementation of [git](https://git-scm.com/) (a distributed version
control system) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Why?

I wanted a fun project to learn more about the Rust programming language and git
inner workings at the same time. The sole purpose of this project is
educational. As a challenge I also restricted myself to the Rust standard
library, thus re-implementing everything else that I might need such as: sha-1
hash function, zlib compress/decompress functions, etc. This is absurd and
definitely not good practice, but again the only aim was to learn, so every
opportunity is a great excuse to code in Rust!
